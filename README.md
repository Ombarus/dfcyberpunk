# DF Cyberpunk 3 (working name)


## Introduction

This is currently nothing more than a barebone prototype / playground for a Need-Based AI system I'm exploring. I would like to make it into a sort of Procedurally Generated City where people can live and hold jobs. For now the goal is only to get the city feel alive. In the future I plan to allow players to take over NPCs and live (or break) their live.

### Related Gameplay idea 1
2d top-down GTA gameplay. (Think hotline miami?)

City is procedurally generated and populated with "agents". The agents have goals and desires. They own stuff related to their goals and desires.

Similar to DF. World might be destructible?

The player can do pretty much anything. Kill people, steal cars, destroys buildings, etc. The idea is to make the agents stable enough that they recover and incorporate the players action in their life.

Setting could be modern or cyberpunk

### Related Gameplay ideas 2
Randomly generated City (Sprawl) with randomly generated megacorpo owning pretty much every building in the city.

Player create character similar to shadowrun. Initial lifestyle dictate spawn location inside one of the city apartment complex.

Randomly generated NPC give the player "runs" (missions) to complete inside other buildings in the city. Building have a "security rating" that dictate how hard it is to infiltrate (harder NPC, more cyber augments, more security, different layouts, etc.)

Randomly generated Clinic, bars, etc. Clinics can install cyberware. Magic shop can sell spell and components.

Players could eventually make enough Nuyen to upgrade their living.

If all this is not enough the game could add vehicle, drones and squad based gameplay
