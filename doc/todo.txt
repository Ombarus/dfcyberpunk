- FIX: Delivery doesn't do multiple stop like it's supposed to
- FIX? If the AI has nothing better to do it might re-trigger the same action even though it's already "done"... finishing it instantly and restarting every frame. Can I stop the AI from re-running a "already" finished task because it has nothing better to do?
- FIX: WorkInShop doesn't seem to select the right random path location
- DESIGN: ProcGen (Maybe prefab buildings "grid" placed randomly?) (Need to research how to make it look more organic, maybe "neighborhood" attributes to create "biomes"?)
- Allow Default Action to jump to a new action if score is more than x% of current action
- Design new Jobs
  ~ Cook in a restaurant kitchen (Basic Boilerplate, need expension)
  ~ Waiter in a restaurant (Basic Boilerplate, need expension)
  - Doc (AI can be "sick"?) (cyberdoc, AI might need implant for work?)
  - Security guard (might require cyberware implants?)
- Bring back Skill system from initial proto (ie: AI can only perform certain plans if it has the skill)
  - Cooking skill
  - Driving skill
  - Medical skill
  - Electronic skill (for cyberdoc and maybe matrix stuff later?)
- DESIGN: I have Mutliple Floors and a prototype transparency but it doesn't work great.
- Implement vision and memory (IA should see ads and remember them (this will limit the scope of ActionPlans to consider))
- MegaCorpo?
  - Each MegaCorpo produces certain essentials
    - Medicine
    - Weapons
    - Furniture
    - Security
  - Each MegaCorpo has an ecosystem
    - Own large buildings
    - Own Security forces (need employee)
    - Has a single CEO
    - Has Scientist (valuable resource for shadowruns)
- Can I standardize coefficients (player base + item bonus + moods + environ + tool quality + exp + ???) (ex: fast sleeper in a good bed in a lavish bedroom in a quiet neibhorhood)
  - Can later tie into goals and dreams (a person with insomnia would invest in good pillows and bedroom furnitures to gain better bonuses)
- DESIGN: Save/Load
  - Need to get rid of Nodes Ref in data


==============================================
============= DONE ===========================
==============================================

X Delivery Driver (deliver food from restaurant but also deliver foodstuff to market, medecine and electronics to doc and cyberdocs?)
X Add camera zoom
X Test Second floor and design transparency (ie: walls and ceiling should disapear when looking inside a building)
X Generic way to apply rewards? How do I distinguish between reward-over-time and instant? (ie: cooking takes energy over several minutes but satisfaction is applied at the end in one shot)
X Fix multiple foodstuff transfer crash
~ Improve "Item finding". When looking for a table it should be one in your appartment (owned?). (Using "Owned" and Hiearchy for now (look at sibling to find "closeby" objects first))
X Need a way to interrupt action with higher prio stuff? (like stop going somewhere if you're too hungry)
	X All Actions in the stack get re-evaluated every frame. This allow any action to break and do something else (In that case, the whole stack get cut and reset)
X Explore inter-entity interactions (ex: using item from kitchen to make food)
	X Have fridge that provide recipes for player to make. Need to dig deeper into how entities update themselves and share more information
		X Advertisement provide actionplan, but what about other important properties (like how much a job pays, what ingredients are necessary for a recipe, etc.)
X Develop inventory (is inventory an entity? can it take actions? (rot?) how do npc interact with it?)
	X For now, inventory contains Nodes so I can access propriety like position, export vars, etc.
