X Need a way to interrupt action with higher prio stuff? (like stop going somewhere if you're too hungry)
	- All Actions in the stack get re-evaluated every frame. This allow any action to break and do something else (In that case, the whole stack get cut and reset)
~ Explore inter-entity interactions (ex: using item from kitchen to make food)
	- Have fridge that provide recipes for player to make. Need to dig deeper into how entities update themselves and share more information
		- Advertisement provide actionplan, but what about other important properties (like how much a job pays, what ingredients are necessary for a recipe, etc.)
~ Develop inventory (is inventory an entity? can it take actions? (rot?) how do npc interact with it?)
	- For now, inventory contains Nodes so I can access propriety like position, export vars, etc.
- Generic way to apply rewards? How do I distinguish between reward-over-time and instant? (ie: cooking takes energy over several minutes but satisfaction is applied at the end in one shot)



-- (need inter-entity interaction) can I standardize coefficients (player base + item bonus + moods + environ + tool quality + exp + ???) (ex: fast sleeper in a good bed in a lavish bedroom in a quiet neibhorhood)
	-- Can later tie into goals and dreams (a person with insomnia would invest in good pillows and bedroom furnitures to gain better bonuses)
