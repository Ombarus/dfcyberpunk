- Fix multiple foodstuff transfer crash
- Bring back Skill system from initial proto
  - Cooking skill
  - Driving skill
  - Medical skill
  - Electronic skill (for cyberdoc and maybe matrix stuff later?)
- Design new Jobs
  - Cook in a restaurant kitchen
  - Waiter in a restaurant
  - Doc (AI can be "sick"?) (cyberdoc, AI might need implant for work?)
  - Delivery Driver (deliver food from restaurant but also deliver foodstuff to market, medecine and electronics to doc and cyberdocs?)
  - Security guard (might require cyberware implants?)
- Test Second floor and design transparency (ie: walls and ceiling should disapear when looking inside a building)
- Add camera zoom
- Allow Default Action to jump to a new action if score is more than x% of current action
- Improve "Item finding". When looking for a table it should be one in your appartment (owned?).
- Implement vision and memory (IA should see ads and remember them (this will limit the scope of ActionPlans to consider))
- MegaCorpo?
  - Each MegaCorpo produces certain essentials
    - Medicine
    - Weapons
    - Furniture
    - Security
  - Each MegaCorpo has an ecosystem
    - Own large buildings
    - Own Security forces (need employee)
    - Has a single CEO
    - Has Scientist (valuable resource for shadowruns)

-- Can I standardize coefficients (player base + item bonus + moods + environ + tool quality + exp + ???) (ex: fast sleeper in a good bed in a lavish bedroom in a quiet neibhorhood)
	-- Can later tie into goals and dreams (a person with insomnia would invest in good pillows and bedroom furnitures to gain better bonuses)

X Need a way to interrupt action with higher prio stuff? (like stop going somewhere if you're too hungry)
	X All Actions in the stack get re-evaluated every frame. This allow any action to break and do something else (In that case, the whole stack get cut and reset)
~ Explore inter-entity interactions (ex: using item from kitchen to make food)
	X Have fridge that provide recipes for player to make. Need to dig deeper into how entities update themselves and share more information
		X Advertisement provide actionplan, but what about other important properties (like how much a job pays, what ingredients are necessary for a recipe, etc.)
~ Develop inventory (is inventory an entity? can it take actions? (rot?) how do npc interact with it?)
	- For now, inventory contains Nodes so I can access propriety like position, export vars, etc.
X Generic way to apply rewards? How do I distinguish between reward-over-time and instant? (ie: cooking takes energy over several minutes but satisfaction is applied at the end in one shot)
